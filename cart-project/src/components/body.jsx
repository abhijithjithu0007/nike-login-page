                <p>Created for the hardwood but taken to the streets, 
                    the Nike Dunk Low Retro returns with crisp overlays 
                    and original team colours. This basketball icon
                     channels '80s vibes with premium leather in the upper 
                     that looks good and breaks in even better. Modern footwear 
                     technology helps bring the comfort into the 21st century.
